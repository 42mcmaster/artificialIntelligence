# AI Lesson 03d Team Project: Movie Database & Recommendation System

## Overview

Build a movie database and recommendation system that combines SQLite with decision-making logic. This project reinforces database concepts while showing how real systems (like Netflix) work.

**Note about AI:**
This project **feels like AI** because it makes decisions using data ‚Äî like recommending a movie based on your favorite genre. But it's **not real AI yet** because the rules are written by us, not learned by the computer.  We will get there ("real AI") soon though. 


**Team Size:** 2-3 students per team

---

## Project Requirements

Your project must include:

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create a SQLite database with **at least 3 tables**
- [ ] Use **at least 3 different data types** (INTEGER, TEXT, REAL)
- [ ] **Insert at least 10 records** total across all tables
- [ ] Implement **at least 5 different queries** (SELECT statements)
- [ ] Use **WHERE clauses** to filter data (in at least 2 queries)
- [ ] Include **at least one decision tree** that uses database data
- [ ] Store results/decisions back to the database
- [ ] Write code with clear comments
- [ ] Handle basic error checking (check if results exist before using them)

### Code Quality Requirements
- [ ] Professional code structure with functions
- [ ] Clear variable names
- [ ] Organized layout with headers/sections
- [ ] Input validation where appropriate (e.g., `.lower()` for text)
- [ ] Proper database management (`commit()`, `close()`)

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Database schema diagram (tables, columns, data types)
- [ ] Sample data showing what's in each table
- [ ] Test plan with at least 5 test cases
- [ ] Explanation of how your system works (2-3 paragraphs)

## Documentation Template

### Program Overview

[Write 2-3 paragraphs explaining]:
- What your program does
- How it uses databases
- How it uses decision logic
- Real-world application

### Database Structure

[Describe each table]:
- What data it stores
- Why it's important
- How it connects to other tables

### How It Works

[Explain the process]:
- How data is added
- How queries work

---

## Grading Rubric

| Category | Points | Criteria |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Database Design** | 25 | 3+ tables, appropriate data types, logical structure |
| **Data & Queries** | 25 | 10+ records, 5+ queries, proper WHERE clauses |
| **Decision Logic** | 20 | Clear decision tree, uses database data, stores results |
| **Code Quality** | 15 | Comments, functions, clean code, error handling |
| **Schema Documentation** | 8 | Clear diagram showing tables and relationships |
| **Test Plan** | 5 | 5+ test cases covering different scenarios |
| **Teamwork** | 2 | Both partners contributed equally |
| **TOTAL** | **100** | |

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Only 1-2 tables** - Not enough complexity
‚úÖ **Use 3-5 tables** - Shows understanding of relationships

‚ùå **No WHERE clauses** - Just getting all data
‚úÖ **Filter data with WHERE** - Shows query skill

‚ùå **Decision tree doesn't use database data**
‚úÖ **Query first, then decide** - Proper pattern

‚ùå **Forget to commit()** - Changes not saved
‚úÖ **Always commit after changes** - Data persists

‚ùå **No error handling** - Crashes if data missing
‚úÖ **Check if results exist** - Graceful handling

‚ùå **All one big function** - Hard to follow
‚úÖ **Use multiple functions** - Organized, reusable

---

## Helpful Tips

### Planning (20 minutes)
1. Choose your project
2. Sketch your tables on paper
3. Decide what data each table stores
4. Plan what queries you'll need
5. Think about your decision logic

### Building (1-2 class periods)
1. Start with setup_database() function
2. Add sample data
3. Test queries one by one
4. Add decision tree logic
5. Test the whole flow

### Testing (30 minutes)
1. Run through test plan
2. Try edge cases (empty results, missing users)
3. Check database file to verify data
4. Make sure decisions are correct
5. Verify recommendations are stored

### Finishing (30 minutes)
1. Clean up code - add comments
2. Create schema diagram
3. Document test results
4. Write program explanation
5. Review with partner

---

## Extension Challenges

If you finish early:

**Challenge 1:** Add sorting capability
- Sort recommendations by rating
- Sort movies by year or rating

**Challenge 2:** Add statistics
- Average rating by genre
- Most popular genre
- User recommendation history

**Challenge 3:** Add user input
- Let users add new movies
- Let users rate movies
- Personalized user preferences

**Challenge 4:** Add filtering
- Recommend only recent movies
- Avoid movies user already watched
- Recommend movies similar to favorites

---

**Remember:** A database is just organized storage. Think about what data you need to store, organize it into logical tables, then query it to make smart decisions!
