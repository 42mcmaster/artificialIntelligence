# AI Lesson 01: What is Artificial Intelligence?

## Learning Objectives
- Define artificial intelligence and distinguish it from traditional programming
- Identify examples of AI in everyday life
- Understand the difference between rule-based systems and learning systems
- Recognize the three main types of AI approaches

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is when computers perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as:
- Recognizing faces in photos
- Understanding spoken language
- Making recommendations
- Playing games
- Driving cars
- Answering questions

### The Key Difference

**Traditional Programming:**
```
Input → Rules (written by programmer) → Output
```

**Artificial Intelligence:**
```
Input + Output Examples → AI learns patterns → Can handle new inputs
```

## Traditional Programming vs. AI

### Example: Spam Filter

**Traditional Programming Approach:**
```python
def is_spam(email):
    # Programmer writes ALL the rules
    if "FREE MONEY" in email:
        return True
    if "CLICK HERE NOW" in email:
        return True
    if "You won" in email:
        return True
    return False
```

**Problem:** What if spam gets creative? You'd need to update the code constantly!

**AI Approach:**
```
AI examines thousands of spam and non-spam emails
↓
AI learns patterns (without explicit rules)
↓
AI can identify NEW spam it's never seen before
```

**Key Insight:** The programmer doesn't write the rules—the AI discovers them!

## Real-World AI Examples

### 1. **Netflix Recommendations** 🎬
- **What it does:** Suggests shows you might like
- **How:** Analyzes what you've watched, what similar people watched, and learns patterns
- **Traditional approach would require:** Manually programming rules for millions of users and shows (impossible!)

### 2. **Snapchat Filters** 📸
- **What it does:** Recognizes your face and adds effects
- **How:** AI learned from millions of face images to detect facial features
- **Traditional approach would require:** Writing code for every possible face, angle, lighting (impossible!)

### 3. **Google Translate** 🌍
- **What it does:** Translates between 100+ languages
- **How:** AI learned from millions of translated documents
- **Traditional approach would require:** Programming every grammar rule and word combination (nearly impossible!)

### 4. **Siri / Alexa** 🗣️
- **What it does:** Understands spoken commands
- **How:** AI learned speech patterns from recordings
- **Traditional approach would require:** Programming rules for every accent, speed, and phrase (impossible!)

## Three Main Approaches to AI

### 1. Rule-Based Systems (Decision Trees)
- Programmer creates explicit rules
- Computer follows the rules exactly
- **Example:** "If temperature > 80°F, recommend shorts"
- **Good for:** Well-defined problems with clear rules

**We'll start here with Decision Trees!**

### 2. Machine Learning (ML)
- Computer learns patterns from data relatively **"simple" patterns**
- No explicit rules programmed
- **Example:** AI looks at 1000 weather days and learns when people wore shorts
- **Good for:** Complex patterns humans can't easily describe

### 3. Neural Networks / Deep Learning
- Inspired by human brain structure
- Learns **very complex patterns** through many layers
- **Example:** Recognizing any cat in any photo
- **Good for:** Very complex tasks like vision and language

## Visual Comparison

# 🧩 Traditional Programming

**Programmer → Writes Rules → Computer Executes**

**Example:**
> If age < 13, deny account

**Key Idea:**
- Rules are **hard-coded** by the human programmer.
- The program follows exact instructions, with no learning or adaptation.
- This is the foundation of most classical software development.

# ⚙️ Rule‑Based AI (Expert Systems)

**Human Experts → Encode Knowledge → AI Follows**

**What does "encode knowledge" mean?**  
It means **manually writing IF/THEN rules** that capture the expert’s understanding of a topic.

**Example:**
> If patient has fever **AND** cough → possible flu

**Key Idea:**
- AI does **not learn** from data.
- All logic is written by humans based on expert domain knowledge.
- Common in early medical and diagnostic systems (1980s–2000s).

# 🤖 Machine Learning (e.g., Decision Trees)

**Data → Algorithm Learns Patterns → AI Makes Decisions**

**What does "learns patterns" mean?**  
The AI **discovers its own IF/THEN rules** by analyzing examples (in supervised learning, those examples are labeled).

**Example:**
> Given weather & user activity data, AI learns:  
> *sunny AND temp > 70 → recommend beach*

**Key Idea:**
- The model finds the rules **automatically**.
- It can improve as more data is collected.
- Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression all fit here.

## When to Use Each Approach

| Approach | Best For | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Traditional Programming** | Simple, clear rules | Calculator, login system |
| **Rule-Based AI** | Multiple conditions, decision-making | Medical diagnosis checklist, game AI |
| **Machine Learning** | Pattern recognition, predictions | Face recognition, spam detection |

## AI is Already Everywhere

Let's identify AI in YOUR daily life:

**Social Media:**
- Which posts appear in your feed? *AI*
- Face tagging in photos? *AI*
- Content moderation? *AI*

**Shopping:**
- Product recommendations? *AI*
- "You might also like..."? *AI*
- Fraud detection on your card? *AI*

**Entertainment:**
- YouTube video suggestions? *AI*
- Spotify playlists? *AI*
- Video game opponents? *AI (sometimes)*

**School/Work:**
- Grammar checking (Grammarly)? *AI*
- Autocomplete in Google Search? *AI*
- Photo enhancement on your phone? *AI*

## What AI is NOT

❌ **AI is not magic** - It's math and patterns
❌ **AI is not always "smart"** - It can make mistakes
❌ **AI doesn't "understand" like humans** - It recognizes patterns
❌ **AI can't do everything** - It's trained for specific tasks

## The AI Spectrum

```
Simple ←──────────────────────────────────────→ Complex

Thermostat        Decision Trees       Image Recognition      Self-Driving Cars
(if/else)         (many if/else)       (ML patterns)          (Deep Learning)
```

## Key Points

1. **AI makes computers act intelligently** without programming every single rule
2. **Traditional programming** requires explicit instructions for everything
3. **Rule-based AI (Decision Trees)** uses programmer-defined logic but handles complex decisions
4. **Machine Learning** discovers patterns from data without explicit programming
5. **AI is everywhere** in modern technology
6. **Different problems need different AI approaches**

## Discussion Questions

Think about these (we'll discuss in class):

1. **Can you identify 3 places you used AI today without realizing it?**
2. **When would traditional programming be BETTER than AI?**
   - Hint: Think about a calculator. Do we want it to "learn" or follow exact rules?
3. **What's something that would be hard to program traditionally but easy for AI?**
   - Hint: Think about recognizing your friend's face

## Looking Ahead
