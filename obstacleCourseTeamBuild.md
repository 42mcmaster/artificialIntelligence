# 🕶️ Blindfold Obstacle Course  
### + Team Challenges & Communication Drills

**Listen. Trust. Solve.**  
Teamwork meets critical thinking!

---

## 👥 Teams & Roles

**15 Students → 5 Teams of 3**

Each team has:
- 🧑‍🦯 **Walker**: Blindfolded course navigator
- 🗣️ **Guide**: Gives verbal navigation
- 🎤 **Challenge Voice**: Speaks only during challenge checkpoints


---

## 🔧 Course Structure

**Start → Maze → Checkpoint 1 → Maze → Checkpoint 2 → Maze → Finish**

- Maze built from **chairs & tables**
- **Touching obstacles = 10 second penalty** 
- **Checkpoints = focused team challenges** where the walker can only LISTEN to the challenge voice, NO TALKING!

---

## ☝️ Rule Summary

- Guide uses **voice only** — no touch or leading
- Walker is **blindfolded** the entire course and can not speak!
- Challenge Voice **steps in only at checkpoint tables**
- If Walker **touches an obstacle**:
  - Return to the **last checkpoint** and wait 10 secs
---

## Ok, let's make teams!

---
## Walker's must stay in class facing the corner and can't watch while we set up the course.
