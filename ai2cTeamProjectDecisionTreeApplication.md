# AI Lesson 02c Team Project: Decision Tree Application

## Overview

Work with a partner to design and code a decision tree program that solves a real-world problem. This project combines your Python skills with AI decision-making concepts.

**Team Size:** 2 students per team

**Time:** This project should take approximately 2-3 class periods

---

## Project Requirements

Your decision tree program must include:

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] At least **3 user inputs** (questions to gather information)
- [ ] At least **2 levels of nested if statements**
- [ ] At least **4 different possible outcomes/recommendations**
- [ ] Use `.lower()` to handle text input variations
- [ ] Include comments explaining your logic
- [ ] Professional output with clear formatting
- [ ] A header with program title and team members' names

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] A **flowchart or diagram** of your decision tree (hand-drawn or digital)
- [ ] A **test plan** showing at least 4 different test cases
- [ ] Brief explanation (3-4 sentences) of what problem your program solves

---

## Team Roles

**Both team members should contribute to all aspects**, but you may divide initial responsibilities:

### Role Option 1: Designer
- Sketch the initial decision tree flowchart
- Design the user experience (questions and output messages)
- Plan test cases
- Help debug code

### Role Option 2: Coder
- Write the initial Python code structure
- Implement the if/elif/else logic
- Add input validation
- Help refine flowchart

**Important:** After initial responsibilities, **swap roles** and review each other's work. Both students should understand all parts of the project.

## Code Template

```python
"""
Decision Tree Program: [YOUR TITLE]
Team Members: [Name 1] and [Name 2]
Date: [Date]
Description: [Brief description of what this program does]
"""

print("=" * 60)
print("[YOUR PROGRAM TITLE]")
print("=" * 60)
print()

# Gather information (at least 3 inputs)
input1 = input("Question 1: ").lower()
input2 = input("Question 2: ").lower()
input3 = input("Question 3: ")

print()  # Blank line for formatting
print("-" * 60)
print("RECOMMENDATION:")
print("-" * 60)

# Decision tree logic (at least 2 levels of nesting, 4 outcomes)
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # Outcome 1
        print("Recommendation: [Outcome 1]")
        print("Reason: [Why this recommendation]")
    else:
        if condition3:
            # Outcome 2
            print("Recommendation: [Outcome 2]")

        print("Reason: [Why this recommendation]")

print()
print("=" * 60)
print("Thank you for using [Your Program Name]!")
print("=" * 60)
```

## Test Plan Template

Create a document with at least 4 test cases:

```
TEST CASE 1: [Describe the scenario]
Input 1: [value]
Input 2: [value]
Input 3: [value]
Expected Output: [What should happen]
Actual Output: [What actually happened]
Pass/Fail: [Circle one]

TEST CASE 2: [Describe different scenario]
Input 1: [value]
Input 2: [value]
Input 3: [value]
Expected Output: [What should happen]
Actual Output: [What actually happened]
Pass/Fail: [Circle one]

[Continue for at least 4 test cases...]
```

**Make sure your test cases cover:**
- Different paths through your decision tree
- Edge cases (extreme values)
- All possible outcomes

---

## Flowchart Requirements

Draw a flowchart showing your decision tree. Include:
- Rectangular boxes for outputs/actions
- Diamond shapes for decisions/questions
- Arrows showing the flow
- Labels on all arrows (YES/NO or specific values)

**Example flowchart structure:**
```
        ┌─────────────┐
        │   START     │
        └──────┬──────┘
               │
        ┌──────▼──────┐
        │ Question 1? │
        └──────┬──────┘
               │
        ┌──────┴──────┐
        │             │
     [YES]           [NO]
        │             │
  ┌─────▼─────┐ ┌────▼────┐
  │Question 2?│ │Question3?│
  └─────┬─────┘ └────┬────┘
  
  [Continue tree structure...]
```

You can draw this:
- By hand (neatly!)
- Using Google Drawings
- Using diagrams.net (free)
- Using any flowchart tool

## Tips for Success

### Planning Phase (15-20 minutes)
1. **Choose your project** together
2. **Brainstorm factors** - what information do you need to ask?
3. **Sketch the flowchart** on paper first
4. **List all possible outcomes** - aim for 4-6
5. **Decide on roles** for initial work

### Coding Phase (1-2 class periods)
1. **Start with the template** above
2. **Write one branch at a time** - test as you go
3. **Add formatting** (lines, emojis, spacing) to make output clear
4. **Test frequently** - don't wait until the end!
5. **Use comments** to explain complex logic
6. **Ask questions** if you get stuck

### Testing Phase (20-30 minutes)
1. **Each partner runs through different test cases**
2. **Try to break your program** - test extreme values
3. **Make sure all 4+ outcomes are reachable**
4. **Fix any bugs** you discover
5. **Clean up formatting** and add final touches

### Documentation Phase (30 minutes)
1. **Create final flowchart** (digital or neatly hand-drawn)
2. **Write up test cases** with actual results
3. **Write program description** (what it does, why it's useful)
4. **Review code** - add any missing comments
5. **Practice your demo** - both partners should be able to explain

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Mistake:** One person does all the work
✅ **Solution:** Divide initial tasks, then review together

❌ **Mistake:** Decision tree is too shallow (only 1 level of if statements)
✅ **Solution:** Add nested conditions for more sophisticated decisions

❌ **Mistake:** Forgot to use .lower() on text input
✅ **Solution:** Add .lower() to all text comparisons

❌ **Mistake:** Not testing all paths
✅ **Solution:** Create test plan BEFORE coding, ensure every outcome is tested

❌ **Mistake:** Poor formatting makes output hard to read
✅ **Solution:** Use print("-" * 60), blank lines, and clear labels

❌ **Mistake:** Confusing variable names (x, y, z)
✅ **Solution:** Use descriptive names (budget, genre, difficulty)
